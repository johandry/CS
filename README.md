# C[loud]S[cripts]

CloudScripts (CS) is where all my day to day scripts, templates and frameworks are stored.

## Installation

Execute only this command to install all the scripts and files of CS in their respective location.

```bash
curl -s https://cs.johandry.com/install | bash
```

## Updates

Once the scripts are installed, they can be updated with the parameter ``--update``. Example: ``sm --update``

If you only want to update the Common Utility script, execute:

```bash
bash ~/bin/common.sh --update
```
